<h4> Targets for Weeks 1 and 2 </h4>

<ol>
<li> The first units that we will look at are: Units 3, 4 and 5</li>
<li> Aside from Minitab learning outcomes, sections 3 and 4 really just require some reading and comprehension.</li>
<li> Although each unit should correspond to a week, I would like to get through these quickly (i.e. by end of week 2). </li>
<li> <b>Remark:</b> Units 1 and 2 will be postponed until later. </li>
<li> We started the course with an on-site tutorial on 3rd September. We looked at elements from units 3,5 and 6.</li>
<li> Listed below are the key points from each unit, with some points about Minitab listed separately.</li>
</ol>
<br>

<h4> Unit 3 - Theory Elements </h4>

There are several theoretical concepts and definitions in this section. It is important to have a clear idea of the following definitions.
<ol>
<li> Be able to distinguish between a <b>population</b> and a <b>sample</b>. 
<li> Be able to distinguish between <b>parameter values</b> and <b>Statistic</b>s, and know how those values are related to populations and samples.
<li> Be able to distinguish between <b>Quantitative data</b> and <b>Qualitative data</b>.
<ul>
<li><emph> (Remark: For our own purposes, conside the differences between <b>Numeric data</b> and <b>Categorical data.</b>) </emph>
</ul>
<li> Be able to distinguish between <b>discrete variables</b> and <b>continuous variables</b> (i.e. counts vs measurements).
</ol>

<b> Remark: </b>Scales of Measurement are useful to know, but I am not placing as much emphasis on that section of unit .
<br>
<br>
<h4> Unit 4 - Graphical Procedures </h4>

A lot of Material in this section related to constructing graphics in Minitab. 
<br>Aside from Minitab, all I really want for you is to be able to 
understand and interpret the various types of charts.

<ol>
<li> I would like you to be able to understand a statistical frequency table (see: Table 4.2 Blemish / Flash etc). </li>
<li> (Remark: You will not be required to construct such a table by hand, in an exam situation.) </li>

<li> While I would like you to be able to interpret bar charts, pie charts and histograms, do not spend much time on them. </li>
<li> (Remark: Again, you will not be required to construct any types of charts by hand, in an exam situation.)</li>

</ol>

<br>
<br>

<h4> Unit 5 - Numerical Methods </h4>
<br>
<b> Learning outcomes that relate to an exam situation: </b>


<b> 1. Measures of Centrality</b>
<ul>
<li> I will require you to know how to compute a sample mean and sample median, using a hand-held calculator. </li>
<li> (Remark: You will not be required to compute a trimmed mean. It is good to understand what it is for though).</li>
<li> (Remark: the mode is useful to know, but not particularly important for this module)</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>

<b> 2. Measures of Dispersion</b>
<ul>
<li> I will require you to know how to compute a sample variance and standard deviation, using a hand-held calculator. </li>
<li> I will require you to know how to compute the range, the quartiles (Q1 and Q3) and the inter-quartile range. </li>
<li> (Remark: Z-scores are useful to know now, but really we will be using them in a later unit.)
</ul>

<br>
<br>

<b> 3. Boxplots </b>
<ul>
<li> Using the sample median, Q1 and Q3 and the IQR, be able to construct a boxplot.
<li> Be able to compute the <b> Upper Fence </b>  and <b> Lower Fence </b>.
<li> Be able to identify outliers using these fences.
<li> You <b>will</b> be expected to be able to draw a boxplot by hand, in an exam situation.
</ul>

<b> 4. Other Topics (Not Examinable) </b>
It is useful to be familiar with a couple of topics from this unit, but do not consider them to be core material for the exam.
<ul>
<li> Outliers and Skewness
<li> The mode
<li> The Trimmed Mean
<li> Tukey's Five Number Summary
</ul>
