Taguchi methods (Japanese: タグチメソッド) are statistical methods, or sometimes called robust design methods, developed by Genichi Taguchi to improve the quality of manufactured goods, and more recently also applied to engineering,[1] biotechnology,[2][3] marketing and advertising.[4] Professional statisticians have welcomed the goals and improvements brought about by Taguchi methods,[editorializing] particularly by Taguchi's development of designs for studying variation, but have criticized the inefficiency of some of Taguchi's proposals.[5]

Taguchi's work includes three principal contributions to statistics:

A specific loss function
The philosophy of off-line quality control; and
Innovations in the design of experiments.
