<h2>Dredging </h2>

<p>
Data dredging (data fishing, data snooping) is the inappropriate (sometimes deliberately so) use of data mining to uncover misleading relationships in data. Data-snooping bias is a form of statistical bias that arises from this misuse of statistics. Any relationships found might appear to be valid within the test set but they would have no statistical significance in the wider population.
<p>
Data dredging and data-snooping bias can occur when researchers either do not form a hypothesis in advance or narrow the data used to reduce the probability of the sample refuting a specific hypothesis. Although data-snooping bias can occur in any field that uses data mining, it is of particular concern in finance and medical research, both of which make heavy use of data mining techniques.
<p>
The process of data mining involves automatically testing huge numbers of hypotheses about a single data set by exhaustively searching for combinations of variables that might show a correlation. Conventional tests of statistical significance are based on the probability that an observation arose by chance, and necessarily accept some risk of mistaken test results, called the significance. When large numbers of tests are performed, it is always expected that some will produce false results, hence 5\% of randomly chosen hypotheses will turn out to be significant at the 5\% level, 1\% will turn out to be significant at the 1\% significance level, and so on, by chance alone.
<p>
If enough hypotheses are tested, it is virtually certain that some will falsely appear to be statistically significant, since every data set with any degree of randomness contains some bogus correlations. Researchers using data mining techniques can be easily misled by these apparently significant results, even though they are mere artifacts of random variation.
<p>
Circumventing the traditional scientific approach of conducting an experiment without a hypothesis can lead to premature conclusions. Data mining can be used negatively to seek more information from a data set than it actually contains. Failure to adjust existing statistical models when applying them to new datasets can also result in the occurrences of new patterns between different attributes that would otherwise have not shown up. Overfitting, oversearching, overestimation, and attribute selection errors are all actions that can lead to data dredging.

  <h3>Data Dredging</h3>
<ul>
<li> Data dredging, sometimes referred to as ``data fishing" is a data mining practice in which large volumes of data are analyzed seeking any possible relationships between data. The traditional scientific method, in contrast, begins with a hypothesis and follows with an examination of the data. 
<li> Sometimes conducted for unethical purposes, data dredging often circumvents traditional data mining techniques and may lead to premature conclusions. Data dredging is sometimes described as "seeking more information from a data set than it actually contains."

<li> Data dredging sometimes results in relationships between variables announced as significant when, in fact, the data require more study before such an association can legitimately be determined. Many variables may be related through chance alone; others may be related through some unknown factor. 
<li> To make a valid assessment of the relationship between any two variables, further study is required in which isolated variables are contrasted with a control group. Data dredging is sometimes used to present an unexamined concurrence of variables as if they led to a valid conclusion, prior to any such study.

<li> Although data dredging is often used improperly, it can be a useful means of finding surprising relationships that might not otherwise have been discovered. However, because the concurrence of variables does not constitute information about their relationship (which could, after all, be merely coincidental), further analysis is required to yield any useful conclusions.
